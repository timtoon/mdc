# Podbean scraper

I am a big fan of the MegaDumbCast (MDC) and his episodes lambasting some of the cherished Palladium RPG books from my adolescence.

Unfortunately recent events meant the creator is no longer continuing the show. This means closing the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/megadumbcast), the Twitter account, and the Podbean hosting.

Rather than let the episodes disappear forever, this scraper will archive the episodes and their metadata for the future.
